- Cube Sample

  For a truly minimal sample with an interactive user interface, take a look at this sample. The dialog of this sample is also discussed [here](https://github.com/daniel-flassig/pytha-lua-api/wiki/pyui-First-Dialog).

- Game of Life

  This is a fun little sample that runs J. H. Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) inside PYTHA. The fields are represented by cubes.
  
- Menger Sponge

  This sample creates a [Menger Sponge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge) of arbitrary size and level.
  
- Penrose

  In honor of [Sir Roger Penrose OM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose), winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics. A small rhombi [Penrose tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling) generator that can easily be modified to kites and darts.
